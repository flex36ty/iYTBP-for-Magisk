# iYTBP for Magisk v2

This module is for Magisk 13 and above.

I have rewritten it to fit new Magisk template rules. Previously was based on vemacs' [Adfree YouTube Template](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-adfree-youtube-template-t3532753) and Master_T's [iYTBP](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-iytbp-injected-youtube-background-t3560900).

Its main purpose is to have an ad-free and background playback as the Xposed's module [YouTube Background Play](http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.pyler.youtubebackgroundplayback)

It has been tested in AOSP/Lineage based ROMs, Motorola and Samsung's stock. Just flash it within Magisk Manager.

For downloads please visit the [XDA thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-iytbp-magisk-t3619705)

All credit goes to the original developers, I just put stuff together.
