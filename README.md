# iYTBP for Magisk v2.5

This module is for Magisk 13 and above, since I have rewritten it to fit new Magisk template rules.

Previous version was based on vemacs' [Adfree YouTube Template](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-adfree-youtube-template-t3532753) and Master_T's [iYTBP](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-iytbp-injected-youtube-background-t3560900).

Big thanks to ZaneZam, Razerman and laura almeida from XDA for their new "vanced" version which is the new YouTube mod this module is based on.

Its main purpose is to have an ad-free and background playback as the Xposed's module [YouTube Background Play](http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.pyler.youtubebackgroundplayback)

It has been tested in AOSP/Lineage based ROMs, Motorola and Samsung's stock ROMs. Just flash it within Magisk Manager or TWRP.

For downloads please visit the [XDA thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-iytbp-magisk-t3619705)

All credit goes to the original developers, I just put stuff together.
