# Magisk-iYTBP

This module is for Magisk v12 and above. 

It uses vemacs' (https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-adfree-youtube-template-t3532753) and Master_T's iYTBP https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-iytbp-injected-youtube-background-t3560900.

Its main purpose is to have an ad-free and background playback as the Xposed's module http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.pyler.youtubebackgroundplayback

It has been tested with a Moto G4+ running stock and DirtyUnicorns; it can be directly installed in Magisk Manager or flashed via recovery.

All credit goes to the original developers, I just put stuff together.
